# Reload Popup

A popup in the corner of the screen that appears when hot reloading the configuration,
which you can easily add to an existing shell.

You can try it out by running `quickshell -p shell.qml` which will put a simple bar
on the screen. The popup will appear if the file is edited, and display the error
if the configuration is invalid.

After making a good edit:
